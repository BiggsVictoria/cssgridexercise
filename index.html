  <!--
    Goal: Create a grid with 6 children block elements with the display grid property

    Grid Elements
      - Create an <main> containing block
      - Create 6 children <section> elements within the <main>

    Content Elements
      - each section needs an <h2> heading
      - Place placeholder text inside some children,
        and an <img> in others using placehold.it
      - Create at least one link with a hover
        pseudo-class effect
      - Create an unordered list with checkmarks
        inside one of the child elements
      - Apply an alternating background color scheme
        using .bg-color class and nth-child() to the
        child <section> elements
      - Create / play around with any other content/grid declarations.
        If you need some inspiration, here are some examples that I
        keep for my 3844 class: https://codepen.io/collection/DdNPVo/
